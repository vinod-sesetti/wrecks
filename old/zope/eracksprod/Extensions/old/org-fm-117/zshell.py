# grep now accepts --owner, --mmin, --mtime, and --newer options
# Both find and grep now accept a --older option
# Overflow error fixed in descend()
#
# Revision 1.94	 2001/06/02 16:53:57  jerome
# Correction in match_Owner(): When no --owner option is given, objects now
# always match, which is prefectly correct, contrary to the previous behavior.
# There's still a difference in the recursive behavior of grep and find, find is
# OK, grep is not. Don't know why yet.
#
# Revision 1.93	 2001/06/02 11:16:04  jerome
# Modification for correct recursion liomit with maxdepth

# permissions, he doesn't need a Manager role anymore.
#

# First shot at NOTarguments. Seem to work fine.
#
# Revision 1.89	 2001/05/30 21:26:07  jerome
# Version number changed to 1.2
# Big reorganisation in command line option handling:
# we can now choose options which may be specified multiple times
# or only a single time on a particular command line:
# Some options may now be specified multiple times, and
# option arguments may use wildcards too: --type, --id, --owner, more to come.
# find's --user option was renamed to --owner
# find's --name option was renamed to --id
# ZClasses' meta_type attribute is callable, this may have raised errors
# because I didn't tested this. It is now fixed.
#
# Revision 1.88	 2001/05/28 19:21:01  jerome
# Corrected export
#
# Revision 1.87	 2001/05/25 22:00:49  jerome

# arguments.
# deluser was renamed to delusers since it accepts multiple
# arguments

# recursive action.

ZShell is an external Zope method which allows you to manipulate
the ZODB using standard unix shell's commands from within Zope's
Management Interface in your web browser.

All commands do security checks and either work or exit with a
message, depending on your current privileges.

However, you should keep in mind that ZShell is very powerful:
use it carefully, do backups often, and use Zope's Undo facility
when needed.

If the use of ZShell leads to a data loss, your dog being killed, or
your wife/husband going away, then:
